# Installation

Visual Studio will expect the environment variable IDADIR to resolve to your IDA 7.0 installation directory.

Visual Studio will also expect the SDK to be located at %IDADIR%\idasdk. Make sure these folders resolve in Windows properly before attempting to build the project.

# Running the build

Because IDA no longer has a native 32-bit compiled version anymore, the Release/Debug scenarios are the build scripts for the 32-bit version of IDA and Release64/Debug64 are the build scripts for the 64-bit version.

**Do not change the target platform from x64!**
